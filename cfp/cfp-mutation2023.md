# Call for Papers

Mutation analysis involves *mutation* of software artifacts that are then used to evaluate the quality of software verification tools and techniques. It is considered the premier technique for evaluating the fault revealing effectiveness of test suites, test generation techniques and other testing approaches. Ideas derived from mutation analysis have also been used to test artifacts at different levels of abstraction, including requirements, formal specifications, models, architectural design notations and even informal descriptions. Recently, mutation has played an important role in software engineering for AI, such as in verifying learned models and behaviors. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners have investigated diverse forms of mutation, such as training data or test data mutation, in combination with metamorphic testing to evaluate model performance in machine learning and detecting adversarial examples.

[Mutation 2023](https://mutation-workshop.github.io/2023/) aims to be the premier forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss recent advances in the area of mutation analysis and propose new research directions. We invite submissions of both full-length and short-length research papers and especially encourage the submission of industry practice papers.


## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Evaluation of mutation-based test adequacy criteria, and comparative studies with other test adequacy criteria.
- Formal theoretical analysis of mutation testing.
- Empirical studies on any aspects of mutation testing.
- Mutation based generation of program variants.
- Higher-order mutation testing.
- Mutation testing tools.
- Mutation for mobile, internet, and cloud based systems (e.g., addressing QoS, power consumption, stress testing, performance, etc.).
- Mutation for security and reliability.
- Novel mutation testing applications, and mutation testing in novel domains.
- Industrial experience with mutation testing.
- Mutation for artificial intelligence (e.g., data mutation, model mutation, mutation-based test data generation, etc.)


## Types of Submissions

Three types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:

- Full papers (10 pages): Research, case studies.
- Short papers (6 pages): Research in progress, tools.
- Industrial papers (6 pages): Applications and lessons learned in industry.

Each paper must conform to the two columns [IEEE conference publication format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (please use the letter format template and conference option) and must be submitted in PDF format via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mutation2023). 
Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of the workshop. Each submission will be reviewed by three reviewers, and all accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.

Mutation 2023 will employ a *double-anonymous* review process. 
Authors *must* make every effort to anonymize their papers to hide their identities throughout the review process.
