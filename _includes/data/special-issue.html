</span></p>

<p><span>Mutation analysis involves mutation of software artifacts that are then used to evaluate the quality of software verification tools and techniques. It is considered the premier technique for evaluating the fault-revealing effectiveness of test suites, test generation techniques and other testing approaches.
</span></p>

<p><span>
Ideas derived from mutation analysis have also been used to test artifacts at different levels of abstraction, including requirements, formal specifications, models, architectural design notations and even informal descriptions. Recently, mutation has also played an important role in software engineering for AI, such as in verifying trained models and their behaviors. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners have investigated diverse forms of mutation, such as training or test data mutation, in combination with metamorphic testing to evaluate model performance in machine learning and detecting adversarial examples.
</span></p>

<p><span>
In addition to the open call for papers that are on the topics of interest below, all authors with an accepted paper at the 18th edition International Workshop on Mutation Analysis (Mutation), collocated with ICST at Dublin in April 2023, are kindly encouraged to submit the extended versions of their work. We also extend the invitation to papers from the past two editions of the Mutation Workshop, 2021 and 2022, that were held virtually.</span></p>

<h2><a name=TOC-Review-Process></a>Review Process</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>All submissions will be reviewed based on the Software: Testing, Verification and Reliability (STVR) standards and will undergo a rigorous reviewing process. Reviews of extended versions of the papers presented at the previous editions of the Mutation Workshops (i.e., Mutation 2021, 2022, and 2023) may include some of the reviewers of the original papers as well as new reviewers with relevant expertise to ensure the highest possible review quality. The guest editors of the special issue are not permitted to submit.</span></p>


<h2><a name=TOC-Submission></a>Submission</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>For extended versions of workshop or conference papers, it is necessary to include at least 30% new contents and clearly explain the additional contributions. The abstract should be different from that of the original paper, and the proper citation of the original workshop/conference paper is required.

To submit your paper, please use the manuscript submission site for Software Testing, Verification and Reliability (http://wiley.atyponrex.com/journal/stvr) and select "Special Issue Paper". In the cover letter, mention that you are submitting to the â€œInternational Workshop on Mutation Analysis". Additionally, we encourage you to notify us via email when you submit your paper.</span></p>
