    **NOTICE (24 Jan 2024)**: To give a bit of extra time to authors, we decided to have a soft deadline and allow the authors to update their submissions by Jan 31 only if they made initial submissions before the original deadline (Jan 27). 
    **Please, remember to register your paper and submit the title and abstract before the deadline Jan 27.**

<p><span>Mutation 2023 aims to be the premier forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss recent advances in the area of mutation analysis and propose new research directions. We invite submissions of both full-length and short-length research papers and especially encourage the submission of industry practice papers.</span></p>

<h2><a name=TOC-Topics-of-Interest></a>Topics of Interest</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
  <li><span>Evaluation of mutation-based test adequacy criteria, and comparative studies with other test adequacy criteria.</span></li>
  <li><span>Formal theoretical analysis of mutation testing.</span></li>
  <li><span>Empirical studies on any aspects of mutation testing.</span></li>
  <li><span>Mutation based generation of program variants.</span></li>
  <li><span>Higher-order mutation testing.</span></li>
  <li><span>Mutation testing tools.</span></li>
  <li><span>Mutation for mobile, internet, and cloud based systems (e.g., addressing QoS, power consumption, stress testing, performance, etc.).</span></li>
  <li><span>Mutation for security and reliability.</span></li>
  <li><span>Novel mutation testing applications, and mutation testing in novel domains.</span></li>
  <li><span>Industrial experience with mutation testing.</span></li>
  <li><span>Mutation for artificial intelligence (e.g., data mutation, model mutation, mutation-based test data generation, etc.)</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name=TOC-Types-of-Submissions></a>Types of Submissions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Three types of papers can be submitted to the workshop:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
  <li><span>Full papers (10 pages including references): Research, case studies.</span></li>
  <li><span>Short papers (6 pages including references): Research in progress, tools.</span></li>
  <li><span>Industrial papers (6 pages including references): Applications and lessons learned in industry.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>
Each paper must conform to the two columns <a
href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html"><span
style='color:#551A8B'>IEEE conference publication format</span></a>
(please use the letter format template and conference option) and must
be submitted in PDF format via <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icstw23"><span style='color:#551A8B'>EasyChair</span></a>. Submissions will be
evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and
to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of
the workshop. Each submission will be reviewed by three reviewers, and
all accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>
Mutation 2023 will employ a <b>double-anonymous</b> review process. 
Authors <b>must</b> make every effort to anonymize their papers to hide their identities throughout the review process.
See the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/icst-2023/icst-2023-papers#Submitting-to-ICST2023-Q-A">double-anonymous QnA page</a> for more information.
</span></p>

<h2>Special Issue</h2>
Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue on Mutation Analysis in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991689"><span style='color:#551A8B'>Journal of Software: Testing, Verification and Reliability</span></a> (STVR).

<h2>Important Dates </h2>
